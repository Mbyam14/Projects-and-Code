# tsiraM-6502
- Credit to Prof. Brian Gormanly for outlining much of the set up for this project 

tsiraM is a virtual 6502 processor written in TypeScript and running on Node.js.  This project is the practical component of Prof. Gormanly's Computer Organization and Architecture class.  This project strives to accomplish the following goals:
- A deep understanding of how the machine works. There is no better way to learn how computers actually work than to build one!
- You become a high level master of code by using OOP to create a virtual machine
- You become a low level ninja, creating programs in machine instructions to run on your creation! Enriching your understanding of the world below your compiler.
- Your design and debugging skills are pushed to solve problems that will melt your brain.  You will debug machine level code you write on a machine you built!
